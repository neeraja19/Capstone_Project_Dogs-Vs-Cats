Capstone Project - Dogs Vs Cats

This project is based on the Kaggle cometition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition

The Data set includes:
1.train.zip : The training set
2.test1.zip: The testing set

Library dependencies:
sklearn 0.17.1
panda 0.18.0
numpy 1.11.1 -  process the image matrics
tensorflow 0.9.0 - just use the tensorboard to capre the loss and adam curve result data
TFLearn - Deep learning libray featuring API for TensorFlow used to create layers of CNN
os - access the file system to read the image from the train and test directory from machines
random - to shuffle the data to overcome the biasing.
open-cv - to process the image and convertin them to grayscale 
tqdm - shows progress bar
